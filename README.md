Cyber-Sales Intelligence Agent simulates a Super-Committee of coordinated AI agents, each assigned a distinct analytical or creative role.
Given a target company name, the system initiates a sequence of operations — real-time intelligence gathering, contextual analysis, data synthesis, and strategic pitch generation — to produce a comprehensive sales briefing and persuasive outreach message.

It showcases how multi-agent orchestration, prompt engineering, and frontend-AI integration can automate complex B2B intelligence workflows.

✨ Key Features

🧩 Multi-Agent Workflow:
Each AI agent performs a specialized role:
Live-Feed Specialist: Collects real-time social intelligence from Twitter/X, Reddit, and Hacker News for mentions of security issues or public sentiment.
Broad Researcher: Uses Perplexity AI to scan the web for company-related news, press releases, and cyber-incident records.
Deep Analyst: Powered by DeepSeek AI, predicts potential vulnerabilities and evaluates the target’s cybersecurity posture.
Data Synthesizer: Employs Google Gemini Flash to consolidate unstructured information into a coherent intelligence report.
Master Strategist: Uses Google Gemini Pro and OpenAI GPT-4 to generate persuasive, psychologically-driven sales pitches based on the analyzed data.
The Voice: (Simulated) Converts the final pitch into a human-sounding audio message using ElevenLabs API.

📊 Dynamic Status Dashboard:
A visually interactive UI that tracks each agent’s status — Pending, Running, Completed, or Error — in real time.
🧠 AI-Powered Data Synthesis:
Aggregates scattered intelligence into actionable insights, applying models that reason contextually and factually.
💬 Strategic Pitch Generation:
Generates emotionally intelligent sales messages using the FULA (Fear, Urgency, Loss Aversion) framework.
📄 Comprehensive Output:
Produces a clean, structured intelligence briefing and a fully formatted sales pitch ready for professional use.
🎧 Simulated Audio Pitch:
Demonstrates future multimodal potential through text-to-speech integration.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
AI & ML Engines:
Google Gemini API — gemini-2.5-flash (fast synthesis), gemini-2.5-pro (strategic generation)
OpenAI GPT-4 (creative refinement)
DeepSeek AI (technical vulnerability analysis)
Perplexity AI (broad research)
ElevenLabs API (text-to-speech simulation)
Data Sources (Simulated): Twitter/X, Reddit, The Hacker News

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
AI Integration & Orchestration:
Designed a chained AI system where the output of one model feeds into another, forming a cohesive decision pipeline.

Advanced Prompt Engineering:
Engineered role-specific prompts to define tone, purpose, and expertise for each agent, ensuring consistent and context-aware responses.

Asynchronous State Management:
Managed concurrent API calls, progress tracking, and error states in a responsive React interface.

Frontend Development & UX:
Built a clean, dark-mode responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, balancing technical clarity and visual elegance.

System Design & Problem Solving:
Broke down a real-world business intelligence task into modular, automatable components.

📈 What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of AI orchestration and meta-agent design — teaching me how to make multiple LLMs collaborate like a unified entity.
Key learnings include:

The impact of structured multi-prompt systems in defining AI behavior across diverse roles.
Handling long-running asynchronous workflows with effective UI feedback loops.
Managing cross-API interaction between language, research, and multimodal models.
The importance of ethical intelligence sourcing and responsible data synthesis.

🔮 Future Improvements

🔗 Live API Integrations: Replace simulated inputs with live Twitter/X, Reddit, and vulnerability-feed APIs.

🗣️ Real Audio Output: Implement true ElevenLabs or Gemini-audio text-to-speech integration.
🎛️ Custom Agent Selection: Let users enable, disable, or customize AI agents per operation.
⏳ Streaming Responses: Display token-by-token generation for a real-time conversational feel.
☁️ Cloud Sync: Integrate Firebase or Supabase for saving user briefings and pitch history.

🏁 Conclusion

Cyber-Sales Intelligence Agent is a glimpse into the future of AI-driven business intelligence — where multiple specialized models collaborate like a Super-Committee to perform complex reasoning and communication tasks.
It demonstrates how Generative AI, prompt engineering, and frontend orchestration can transform cybersecurity and B2B sales into automated, insight-driven ecosystems.
